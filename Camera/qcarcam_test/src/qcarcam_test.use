QCarCam test application.

Test application that reads a configuration XML for the camera and windowing properties.
It sets up the display windows using the native OS APIs through test_util library.
It sets up the cameras using the QCarCam API. 

======
Usage:
======
qcarcam_test [-config=FILE] [-dumpFrame=FREQ] [-startStop=FREQ | -pauseResume=FREQ] \
    [-noDisplay] [-singlethread] [-printfps=TIME] [-checkbuf=ENABLE] [-showStats=ENABLE] \
    [-c2d=ENABLE] [-cache] [-csc=ENABLE] [-di=MODE] [-nomenu|-nonInteractive] \
    [-fatalErrorRecover] [-checkdualcsi] [-retry] [-seconds=TIME] [-gpioNumber=GPIO] \
    [-gpioMode=MODE] [-allocator=ALLOCATOR]


-config=FILE
    XML configuration file to be used.
    Default if argument unspecified is qcarcam_config.xml

-dumpFrame=FREQ
    Dumps frames to a file when frameID % FREQ == 0 

-startStop=FREQ | -pauseResume=FREQ
    {Stops and starts | [pauses and resumes} the streams when frameID % FREQ == 0 

-noDisplay
    offscreen streaming. Does not post buffers to display.
    Default is onscreen.
    
-singlethread
    Uses single thread to setup and start all streams.
    Default is multithreaded where each stream is setup using its own thread.

-printfps=TIME
    Prints FPS and state report of all streams every TIME seconds

-checkbuf=ENABLE
    Enables checking of buffer states and printing them as part of the FPS report.
    Default is disabled 

-showStats=ENABLE
    Prints performance stats related to API operations
    Default is disabled

-c2d=ENABLE
    Creates extra set of offscreen buffers and coverts using C2D prior to posting to display foramt
    Default is disabled
    
-cache
    Uses cached buffers. Only valid for offscreen operation (i.e. noDiaply)
    Default is disabled

-csc=ENABLE
    Creates extra set of offscreen buffers and converts using CSC library prior to posting to display foramt
    Default is disabled

-di=MODE
    Enable De-Interlacing mode for interlaced content
    Default is disabled

-nomenu|-nonInteractive
    Does not setup or show menu.
    NOTE: Specify this if launching the test app in background

-fatalErrorRecover
    Enable test app to try and recovery stream in cases of fatal errors.
    Stops and starts the stream again.
    Default is enabled

-checkdualcsi
    Enables Dual CSI pattern checker where the left half of the image must match the right half.
    Default is disabled

-retry
    Retries a few times if the ais_server is still in process of detecting streams.

-seconds=TIME
    Exit app after TIME seconds

-gpioNumber=GPIO
    Specify GPIO to be used as toggle
    Default is disabled

-gpioMode=MODE
    Specify action of GPIO toggled
    Default is disabled

-allocator=ALLOCATOR
    Specify buffer allocator.
    For QNX, this can be used to select between pmem v1 or v2 handle used for QCarCam buffers

-hwTimestampBasedFps
    Print FPS based on hardware time stamp.

========
Examples
========
    o Launch with xml config file (default it expects is qcarcam_config.xml)
        "qcarcam_test"

    o to specify config file
        "qcarcam_test -config=test_config.xml"

    o to pause/resume or stop/start after "x" frames:
        "qcarcam_test -pauseResume=100"
        "qcarcam_test -startStop=100"

    o to dump frame after "x" frames:
        "qcarcam_test -dumpFrame=100"

    o to launch in background without menu:
        "qcarcam_test -nomenu &"

FPS Report Example
==================
​
-----------FPS Report - 2.0 sec--------------
| sid | cid | bid |  state (time)| fps  | rel  |
|  0  |  0  |  0  | ok           | 28.5 | 28.3 |
|  0  |  0  |  1  | ok           | 28.5 | 28.3 |
|  1  |  1  |  0  | ok           | 28.5 | 28.3 |
|  1  |  2  |  1  | ok           | 28.5 | 28.3 |
-----------------------------------------------

sid
    Specifies session id - refers to input_device in XML
​
cid
    Specifies camera id - refers to input in XML

bid
    Specifies bufferlist id - refers to stream in XML

​state (time)
    OK - Stream receiving frames and is OK. time will be printed if transition occured
        since the last report. Time will be since first frame after transition.
    
    START - Stream was started but have not received first frame yet. Time since start command returned.
    STOP - Stream is Stopped
    PAUSE - Stream is Paused
    
    ERROR - Stream got an error event and is in error state
    FREEZE - Stream did not get new frames for >1 second. Time will be since the last frame we received.

fps
    Rate of frames recieved from QCarCam
​
Rel
    Rate of frames released to QCarCam
